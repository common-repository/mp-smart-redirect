=== MP smart redirect: Simple 404 redirecter, without entering 404 pages and redirects! ===
Contributors: Mark Puts
Tags: 404, redirect, 404 redirect, redirect 301
Requires at least: 3.7
Tested up to: 3.9.1

== Description ==
Simple plugin to redirect your old URL's that give a 404 to their new URL. For example: you deleted some categories and changed the permalink structure -> Wordpress isn't redirecting your posts to the right page and gives a 404, your old URL was dead-category/my-page.html and it's now /my-page.html. This plugin fixes this issue and creates a 301 redirect to your right url. We don't save any data to your database! So we also don't create logs of your 404's. You can use a different plugin for that like Redirection (recommended to install since you can view and add redirections this plugin might missed).
